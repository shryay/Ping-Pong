# Ping-Pong

A simple browser-based Pong game built with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay: Control the left paddle with your mouse and play against a basic computer AI.
- Responsive and easy-to-understand interface.
- Clean and modern visual design with HTML Canvas rendering.
- Score tracking for both the player and AI.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
2. Move your mouse up and down to control the left paddle.
3. The right paddle (AI) will automatically track and return the ball.
4. Score points by getting the ball past the AI paddle; the AI scores when it gets the ball past you.
5. First to your desired number of points wins—keep track and have fun!
